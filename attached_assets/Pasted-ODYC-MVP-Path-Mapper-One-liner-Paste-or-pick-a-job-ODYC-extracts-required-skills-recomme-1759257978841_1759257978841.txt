ODYC MVP — “Path Mapper”

One-liner: Paste (or pick) a job → ODYC extracts required skills → recommends an existing local program that covers those skills → gives the student a clear, step-by-step enrollment plan.

1) What ODYC shows the student (for your Simplot example)

Target job: Industrial Maintenance Mechanic (Simplot, Rock Springs) — JD calls out hydraulics, pneumatics, alignments, pump/valve rebuilds, blueprint reading, documentation, troubleshooting, physical/conditions, and an aptitude test.

Recommended program: WWCC — Industrial Maintenance Technology (A.A.S. and certificates), which trains in:

Plant safety & rigging; blueprint reading

Bearings, lubrication & centrifugal pumps

Mechanical drives & alignment

Hydraulics & pneumatics

Industrial electricity & motor controls

Vibration analysis, troubleshooting, machining & welding 
westernwyoming.edu

Closest certificate option (fastest on-ramp): Maintenance Mechanic Certificate (choose ~36 credits from INDM courses like Industrial Mechanics I/II, etc.). ODYC can list the relevant INDM courses that map to the JD’s skills.

Why it matches (coverage matrix):

Hydraulics & pneumatics → INDM/ESTM Hydraulics & Pneumatics modules/courses. 
catalog.wwcc.edu

Pumps/bearings/lube → Bearings, lubrication & centrifugal pumps outcomes. 
westernwyoming.edu

Mechanical drives & alignment → Industrial Mechanics sequence & alignment topics. 
westernwyoming.edu

Blueprint reading, electricity/controls, troubleshooting → in the WWCC outcomes/course lineup.

“Next steps” checklist (inside ODYC):

Apply to WWCC Industrial Maintenance (A.A.S. or Maintenance Mechanic Certificate). ODYC links to the program + degrees/cert pages.

Meet with advisor to pick the fastest certificate sequence that hits pumps, pneumatics, alignment early. (Use WWCC class schedule to time your start.)

Prep for employer aptitude screening (Simplot’s JD mentions an aptitude test): ODYC surfaces general mechanical-aptitude resources and recommends WWCC tutoring/test-prep options (no brand-specific claims).

Financial aid & enrollment steps: ODYC links to WWCC’s admissions/aid; encourages FAFSA completion before scheduling blocks.

Timeline options: “1-year certificate → job,” or “A.A.S. (2 years) → broader roles;” ODYC shows a simple Gantt of terms/courses from the certificate picklist.

2) User flows (lean and real)
Student

Start: paste a job or choose “Industrial Maintenance Mechanic (Rock Springs).”

See: “Program Match” card with coverage score, matched outcomes, missing gaps (if any), time/cost notes, and Apply to WWCC button (deep link).

Do: click “Build My Plan” → ODYC creates a 3–4 step plan with dates: application, advising, term start, aptitude-test prep.

Save/Share: email the plan to self/parent; download PDF.

Counselor/Teacher

Confirm ODYC’s recommended program; edit the 3–4 step plan; print for student conference.

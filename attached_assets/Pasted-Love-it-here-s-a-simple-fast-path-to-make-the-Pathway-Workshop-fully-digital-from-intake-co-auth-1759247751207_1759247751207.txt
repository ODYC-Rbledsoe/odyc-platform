Love it—here’s a simple, fast path to make the Pathway Workshop fully digital, from intake → co-authoring → scheduling → artifacts → transcript.

What “digital” means (end-to-end)

Employers enter role info online → you co-author Pathway + Project Cards live → projects get scheduled → students submit artifacts (photos, checklists, short videos) on their phone → mentors/teachers sign off → a Skills Transcript (PDF link) updates automatically.

3-stage build (move fast, de-risk)

Stage 1 — No-code pilot (1–2 weeks)

Intake: Google Form (Employer role intake), Teacher/WBL intake, Student consent.

Database: Airtable (tables: Employers, Roles/Pathways, Project Cards, Rubrics, Students, Artifacts, Consents, Schedules).

Scheduling: Google Calendar slots + Zapier to create events from approved Project Cards.

Artifacts: Google Drive/OneDrive folders auto-created per student+project; upload via link; Airtable records the artifact URL + mentor sign-off.

Transcript: Airtable Interface → one-click PDF export (or Document Studio) summarizing badges & artifacts.

Stage 2 — Lightweight web app (4–6 weeks)

Stack: Next.js/React + Supabase (Auth/Postgres/Storage) or Firebase (Auth/Firestore/Storage).

SSO: Google/MS for students and staff.

Features:

Employer portal: create Pathway → Project Card with guardrails (durations, safety, capacity).

Educator portal: align to WY CTE standards, set credit, roster students.

Student portal (mobile): see projects, apply, upload artifacts, view badges/transcript.

Mentor app (mobile web): approve, comment, sign off.

Admin: consent management, risk flags, reporting.

Stage 3 — V1 polish (8–12 weeks)

Rubrics & badging engine, calendar sync (Google/Microsoft), CSV/SIS roster import, PDF transcript with QR-verifiable link, dashboards (placements, time-to-interview, hours logged).

Roles & flows (digital UX)

Employer SME → “Create Pathway” → add 4–6 Project Cards (objective, steps, safety, artifact, capacity, windows) → submit.

Educator/WBL → map to standards/credit, set eligibility, publish to students.

Student → browse → apply → receive calendar invite/requirements → complete → upload artifact → auto-badge.

Mentor → tap to approve/sign (date, notes, hours) → triggers badge + transcript update.

Minimal data model (keep it tight)

User {role: student|mentor|teacher|admin, orgId}

Employer {name, contacts, locations}

Pathway {title, ksas[], milestones[], badges[], wageBands[]}

ProjectCard {pathwayId, objective, steps[], safety, artifactSpec, durationHrs, capacity, windows[], onsite|school}

Rubric {competency, novice|developing|proficient criteria}

Consent {studentId, guardian name, timestamp, scope}

Artifact {studentId, projectId, files[], mentorSignoff, score, badgeIds[]}

Transcript {studentId, badges[], artifacts[], hours, endorsements[]}

Compliance by design

Consent first (guardian e-signature, media release, transport plan).

Least PII (school ID, no SSNs).

Data retention (e.g., archive artifacts after 24 months).

Accessibility (WCAG AA); FERPA/COPPA language in TOS.

Reporting & KPIs (auto)

Employers: time-to-interview, offers, 90-day retention.

Districts: WBL hours, artifacts/student, audit-ready logs.

Program: pathways authored, projects/month, student engagement.

Templates you can use tomorrow

Project Card fields: Title, Duration, Objective, Prereqs, Steps, Tools/PPE, Safety/JHA notes, Artifact required, Sign-off owner, Capacity/month, Windows, Location.

Rubric row: Competency → Evidence (artifact) → Criteria (Novice/Developing/Proficient) → Sign-off.

Who’s in the digital workshop?

Yes—education partners should attend (CTE teacher + WBL coordinator). If calendars clash: run an employer-only digital session first (collect tasks/safety/artifacts), then a teacher alignment session within 72 hours to map to standards and credit.

If you want, I can spin up the Airtable base + Google Forms structure and give you shareable links you can use for your next workshop, or sketch the Next.js/Supabase schema and user flows as a dev-ready brief.
